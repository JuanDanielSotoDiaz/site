This paper studies how informal and illegal supply chains of raw materials respond to global demand shocks, by exploring the case of the small-scale gold mining during the gold rush in the Peruvian Amazon. For this purpose, this paper estimates the heterogeneous responses of small-scale gold mining to variations in the international price of gold. Using a combination of medium-resolution satellite images and official geographical information of mining sites, this paper provides evidence that differences in mining activity between illegal and non-illegal producers disappear in the wake of high prices. The results suggest that price booms induced a more than proportional proliferation of illegal mining activity in relation to non-illegal gold mining, which might be associated with a rise in the relative profitability of these producers. This might lead to a reconsideration of the current policy approach to limit the profitability of illegal gold producers in the area studied that underestimates the importance of price shocks.
