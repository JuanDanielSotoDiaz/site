Moving from the production of low-processed commodities to downstream basic manufacturing activities within a value chain is a popular strategy in emerging countries. However, the welfare and productivity gains from this process of industrial upgrading, and its distributional impacts in local labor markets are not clear. This study examines the expansion of the copper industry in Chile, the worldâ€™s largest copper producer. The empirical strategy exploits the variation in upgrading from low-processed mine copper to smelting and refined copper exports with two main objectives: 1) measuring the role of resource endowments and export competition in inducing industrial upgrading in local labor markets; and 2) estimating the local welfare and productivity gains from industrial upgrading. The results suggest that: (1) competition in global value chains plays a major role in shaping the development of downstream industries in the smelting and refinement of minerals; (2) the local welfare and productivity gains from industrial upgrading in local labor markets are small; and (3) due to comparative advantages given by resource endowments, the potential gains from industrial policy are largely concentrated in the primary segment of mineral extraction. This evidence supports the promotion of policies that foster alternative forms of upgrading in the lower segments of the value chain in resource-rich economies.
