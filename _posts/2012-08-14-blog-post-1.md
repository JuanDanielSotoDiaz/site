<i>Abstract</i>. Traditionally local labor markets are delineated based on commuting flow data. However, commuting data are expensive to collect, are sporadically collected in developed coun- tries and rarely available in less developed countries. Yet, recent advances in computing capacity and increased availability of satellite imagery offers a unique opportunity to gen- erate labor market areas in poor environment contexts in a cheap, frequent and automated way. This paper assess the potential of satellite images to deliver accurate local labor mar- ket areas by developing an automated satellite-imagery identification methodology. By relying on the well documented mapping between land-use and commuting flows, we show that land-use cover captured with satellite images provides sufficient information to delineate local labor market areas. The performance and practicality of our methodol- ogy is compared to other standard definitions and methods. Our approach replicates the performance of commuting-based methods to delineate local labor markets with a better identification of the heterogeneity between these spatial units.
