Traditionally local labor markets are delineated based on commuting flow data. However, commuting data are expensive to collect, are sporadically collected in developed countries and rarely available in less developed countries. Yet, recent advances in computing capacity and increased availability of satellite imagery offers a unique opportunity to generate labor market areas in poor environment contexts in a cheap, frequent and automated way. This paper assess the potential of satellite images to deliver accurate local labor market areas by developing an automated satellite-imagery identification methodology. By relying on the well documented mapping between land-use and commuting flows, we show that land-use cover captured with satellite images provides sufficient information to delineate local labor market areas. The performance and practicality of our methodology is compared to other standard definitions and methods. Our approach replicates the performance of commuting-based methods to delineate local labor markets with a better identification of the heterogeneity between these spatial units.
