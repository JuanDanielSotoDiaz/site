How urbanization shape structural change out of agriculture across space? Does growth in cities also generate growth and development in rural areas? This article estimates the effects of urbanization and road infrastructure development on the structural transfor- mation of rural villages in Chile. Following a market access approach, these effects are analyzed by estimating the elasticities of urban market access on the population, and farm and non-farm employment of rural villages. Using population censuses and remote sens- ing data for a 25â€“year period, we find in our preferred estimations that a 10% increase in access to urban markets induced in average a 3% increase in the population of rural communities and a 7% in non-farm employment, but non-significant effects in farm em- ployment. These results support the hypothesis of the diversification of the rural economy which also are consistent with the evidence of the intensification of agriculture. Moreover, the evidence suggests important heterogeneous effects across rural areas, that reveal that the farm sector took important advantages from market access in rural areas with better conditions for agricultural production.
