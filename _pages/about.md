I recently completed my PhD at the [London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/geography-and-environment/people/phd-students/juan-soto-diaz). I will join the [School of Economics](https://economics.uq.edu.au) at the [University of Queensland (UQ)](https://economics.uq.edu.au) and the [Sustainable Minerals Institute](https://smi.uq.edu.au) as a Research Fellow in 2024.

My research lies on the intersection of the fields of economic geography, international trade, and development economics. It aims to develop a better understanding of [<i>The Spatial Economy</i>](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20181414) for the design of policies that promote economic growth and development by means of more sustainable and inclusive forms of production.

In my [Job Market Paper](https://juandanielsotodiaz.github.io/site/posts/2013/08/blog-post-2/), I explore the contemporaneous and long-term general equilibrium effects of a resource boom and bust in local labor markets, considering the heterogeneous impacts between Multinational Companies and domestic firms in the resource sector.
