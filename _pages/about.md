Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in Economic Geography at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://lse.ac.uk), [Department of Geography and Environment](https://www.lse.ac.uk/geography-and-environment). My research lies on the intersection of the fields of international trade, development economics, and resource economics. It integrates multiple aspects of [<i>The Spatial Economy</i>](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20181414), aiming to develop a better understanding for the design of policies that promote sustainable forms of production.
