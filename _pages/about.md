Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in Economic Geography at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://lse.ac.uk), [Department of Geography and Environment](https://www.lse.ac.uk/geography-and-environment). My current research lies on the intersection of the fields of international trade, development economics, and resource economics. It integrates multiple aspects of the first- and second-nature geography, analyzing different spatial scales and contexts, aiming to develop a better understanding for the design of policies that promote sustainable forms of production.
