I recently obtained my PhD at the <b>London School of Economics (LSE)</b>. I will join the School of Economics at the <b>University of Queensland (UQ)</b> as a Research Fellow in 2024.

My research lies on the intersection of the fields of economic geography, international trade, and development economics. 

In my Job Market Paper, entitled <i>"Booming Sector, Multinationals, and Local Economic Development"</i>, I explore the average and heterogeneous general equilibrium effects of a resource boom and bust in local labor markets.
