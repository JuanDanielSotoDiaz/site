Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in Economic Geography at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://lse.ac.uk), [Department of Geography and Environment](https://www.lse.ac.uk/geography-and-environment). My research lies on the intersection of the fields of international trade, development economics, and resource and urban economics. It aims to develop a better understanding of [<i>The Spatial Economy</i>](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20181414) for the design of policies that promote economic growth and development by means of more sustainable and inclusive forms of production. In my [Job Market Paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jors.12269), I explore the contemporaneous and long-term general equilibrium effects of a resource boom and bust in local labor markets. In particular, I build over the idea of [<i>local Dutch Disease</i>](https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/85/2/695/4055596) to consider the heterogeneous impacts between Multinational Companies and domestic firms in the resource sector in order to improve our knowledge on the extent to which a resource boom can be consistent with long-term local economic development.
