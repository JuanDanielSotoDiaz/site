I am a Research Fellow in the [School of Economics](https://economics.uq.edu.au) and the [Sustainable Minerals Institute](https://smi.uq.edu.au)  at the <b>University of Queensland (UQ)</b>, where I am currently collaborating to the [Resourcing Decarbonisation Program](https://smi.uq.edu.au/strategic-programs/resourcing-decarbonisation) and the [Global Centre for Mineral Security](https://smi.uq.edu.au/gcms). I obtained my PhD from the <b>London School of Economics (LSE)</b> at the [Department of Geography and Environment]([https://smi.uq.edu.au/gcms](https://www.lse.ac.uk/geography-and-environment)) in 2023. 

My research lies on the intersection of the fields of economic geography, international trade, development economics, and resource and environmental economics. Broadly speaking, it aims to develop a better understanding of the spatial economy for designing policies that promote economic growth and development through more sustainable and inclusive forms of production. 

In my Job Market Paper, entitled [<i>"Booming Sector, Multinationals, and Local Economic Development"</i>](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4460735), I explore the average and heterogeneous implications of a resource boom and bust in local labor markets.
