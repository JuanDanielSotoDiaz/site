I recently obtained my PhD at the <b>London School of Economics (LSE)</b>. I will join the School of Economics at the <b>University of Queensland (UQ)</b> as a Research Fellow in 2024.

My research lies on the intersection of the fields of economic geography, international trade, and development economics. In my [Job Market Paper](https://juandanielsotodiaz.github.io/site/posts/2013/08/blog-post-2/), I explore the contemporaneous and long-term general equilibrium effects of a resource boom and bust in local labor markets, considering the heterogeneous impacts between Multinational Companies and domestic firms in the resource sector.
