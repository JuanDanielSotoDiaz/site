I am a Research Fellow in the [School of Economics](https://economics.uq.edu.au) at the <b>University of Queensland (UQ)</b>. I obtained my PhD from the <b>London School of Economics (LSE)</b> in 2023. 

My research lies on the intersection of the fields of economic geography, international trade, development economics, and resource and environmental economics. 

In my Job Market Paper, entitled [<i>"Booming Sector, Multinationals, and Local Economic Development"</i>](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4460735), I explore the average and heterogeneous implications of a resource boom and bust in local labor markets.
